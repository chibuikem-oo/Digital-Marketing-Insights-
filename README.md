### **Visualization & Insights in Power BI**

- Buyers were more **active during weekdays for lead generation** but **weekend purchases had higher order values**.

### **4. Best Performing Marketing Channels**
- **Influencer marketing yielded the highest ROMI ($95.2K), followed by social media campaigns ($25.8K)**.
- **Search media had the lowest ROMI**, suggesting that paid search ads may not be as effective.
